(1) In addition to the build prerequisites listed by the readme, I also had to install:
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
    sudo apt-get install libffi-dev

(2) matplotlib wouldn't build because it tries to look up the linux distro in order to use it in a help message.
    I don't want matplotlib anyways so I removed it but there were other packages relying on it. I modified buildall.py
    in order to list out packages that had missing dependencies so I could remove them too.

(3) I wanted to use jedi version 0.17 instead of the bundled version 0.15. There were quite a few references to 0.15.
    I had to delete all of the 0.15 files and then fix the errors. Run pyodide/build/mkpkg my_pkg, adjust the version in the 
    makefile in pyodide/packages/my_pkg/makefile, adjust the version in the makefile pyodide/Makefile.

(4) If you rebuild, the process will damage the files pyodide/build/pyodide.* make sure to delete these before rebuilding.
